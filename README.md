# JS Battleships 

JS battleships, at this moment, is a vanilla JavaScript game of Battleships, the riveting duel between friends to sink the others fleet.

The UI is organized into 3 main containers: 
- Class name: "container"
    - Children: "grid-user" and "grid-computer" 
    
Container wraps the user and the computer gameboards. The boards contain 100 divs in a 10X10 pattern, generated by the `createBoard` function in the app.js file. The computer will place its ships randomly after the `createBoard` function has completed using the `generate` function. 

- Class name: "hidden-info"
    - Children: 2 buttons ("rotate" & "start"), 2 h3 elements ("whose-go" & "info")

Hidden-info contains 2 buttons (that aren't hidden) for the user to start the game, and rotate their available ships. Both of the h3 spans were built to display real-time information the user needs to know - like whose turn it is, if and what battleship was just sunk, and so on. 

For isntance, when a user sinks a computer's battleship (which we will know because we know that a battleship takes up 4 divs, and we are keeping a count for hits on each of the ships individually) the "info" element will let the user know what ship was just sunk. 

- Class name: "grid-display"
    - Children: 5 divs, for each of the 5 types of ship in the game 

Grid-display renders the users ships - destroyer, submarine, cruiser, battleship and carrier. Their lengths have been hardcoded in, and they render vertically on default. Using the html drag-and-drop API, the ships can be grabbed by the clicking and dragged onto the user's gameboard. When the "rotate ships" button is pressed all the ship rotate and can be dragged in that position. 

After all the user's ships have been placed the game can begin. When you select a square that the computer has a ship in, it will result in a HIT! and the square will turn red. This is the result of the `playGame` and `revealSquare` functions in app.js. 

Initially it is the user's go. An event listener is attached to each of the computerSquares, when a square is clicked the `revealSquare` function is invoked. This function checks if the computerSquare contains any battleship class name, and increments a count and returns a hit if it does. 

Once all the ships have been sunk, which we decide in the `checkForWins` function, the game will end! 

### Current Problems: 

- The computer always gets a hit. The logic of the computerGo functions needs refactoring. 
- The `checkForWins` function doesn't seem to be working. I wonder why ðŸ¤” 
- When the user ships are rotated the stay in a column flow and overflow the parent div. This just looks bad and I should fix it.
