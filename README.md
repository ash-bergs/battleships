# JS Battleships 

JS battleships, at this moment, is a vanilla JavaScript game of Battleships, the riveting duel between friends to sink the others fleet.

## Phase One: Single Player (Vanilla JS, HTML & CSS)

The body of the document is organized into 3 main containers - `container` (which holds the 2 game boards), `hidden-info` (displays dynamic game updates, like whose turn it is, and what ship has been sunk) & `grid-display` (contains the user's playable ships)

The game boards, `grid-user` and `grid-computer` (the direct children of the `container` div), contain 100 divs in a 10X10 pattern, generated by the `createBoard` function in app.js. The computer will place its ships randomly after the `createBoard` function has completed using the `generate` function, while the `grid-user` board will allow a player to put their ships down. The ships can be rotated inside of the `grid-display` element.

Hidden-info contains 2 buttons (that aren't hidden) for the user to start the game, and rotate their available ships. Both of the h3 spans were built to display real-time information the user needs to know - like whose turn it is, if and what battleship was just sunk, and so on.

Once the user's ships have been placed the game can begin. When you select a square that the computer has a ship in, it will result in a HIT! and the square will turn red. This is the result of the `playGame` and `revealSquare` functions in app.js. Initially it is the user's go. An event listener is attached to each of the computerSquares, when a square is clicked the `revealSquare` function is invoked. This function checks if the computerSquare contains any battleship class name, and increments a count and returns a hit if it does. 

Once all the ships have been sunk, which we decide in the `checkForWins` function, the game will end!

## Phase One: Reflection

### Current Problems: 

- The computer always gets a hit. The logic of the computerGo functions needs refactoring. 
- The `checkForWins` function doesn't seem to be working. I wonder why ðŸ¤” 
- When the user ships are rotated the stay in a column flow and overflow the parent div. This just looks bad and I should fix it.
